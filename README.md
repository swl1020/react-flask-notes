## Basic React/Flask note app
This project was created by following various tutorials and Stack Overflow threads, with the intention of gaining a
better understanding of Python and React, coming from a PHP and Vue background.

This code is likely not optimal, but it gives a decent attempt to provide a backend that handles basic CRUD operations
and a frontend that provides basic display and input.

### To run
Terminal 1:   
`cd /flask-server`  
`python3 init_db.py`  
`source venv/bin/activate`  
`python3 server.py`

Terminal 2:  
`cd client`  
`npm start`
